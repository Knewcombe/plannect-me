			  Plannect.me is a social media club whose goal is to visually connect the planet via pictures of individuals located throughout the different countries of the world. Plannect.me
				<strong>is not a dating web site</strong>, the only way to identify the individuals is by their unique 9 digit number as well as what country they live in.
			</p>
			<p>
				Plannect.me's goal is to populate the site with pictures of people that are not only willing but exited to let the rest of the world see them. This will be a club that anyone can join and enjoy the planet’s most interesting feature…….
				<strong>people!</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				As it stands now, the only groups within the planets population that most of us get to see are models, actors, athletes, politicians and other celebrities. Why not let everyone be seen who wants to be…….
				Eliminating direct interaction between members will reduce the concern of undesirable messages and comments and provide a sense of secure anonymity.

        We project that that the largest percentage of our members will be “viewing” members who simply join to view other member profiles rather than actively posting profile pictures themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plannect.me’s goal is to make each visit a FUN and ENJOYABLE experience. For those members who upload profile images, they will be able to change and update their photos as they wish. These “posting” members will be able to set toggles on their profile to allow other members from around the world to “rate” their pictures. The “viewers” can thumb through profile pictures and offer an anonymous rating between 60 and 100 and the “posting” members can discover how the World sees them. The “posting” member can choose to display this score to fellow club members or keep it private.
